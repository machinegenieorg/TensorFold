"""NVFP4 (NVIDIA ModelOpt's FP4 format) as the Swift 1.5 Flash Next NVFP4 checkpoint stores them, and
the row-invariant kernels that read them: the definition the CUDA path is checked against.

NVFP4 quantizes a linear layer's weights (here: the 512 routed experts; everything else in the checkpoint is
BF16). With K inputs and N outputs a layer is stored as four tensors:

    weight          uint8  [N, K/2]     packed E2M1 nibbles: byte i holds q[2i] (low) and q[2i+1] (high)
    weight_scale    fp8e4m3 [N, K/16]   one scale per 16-value block
    weight_scale_2  fp32   []           a second, per-tensor scale
    input_scale     fp32   []           calibration-time activation scale (this engine serves BF16
                                        activations, so it is not read on the verify path)

The dequantized weight is

    W[n, k] = E2M1(nibble (n, k)) * (fp32(weight_scale[n, k // 16]) * weight_scale_2)

with E2M1 the 16 FP4 values {0, .5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6} and their negations (code = sign << 3 | magnitude),
the fp32 widening of the e4m3 scale exact and the fp32 product taking one rounding — ModelOpt's own
reference (``NVFP4QTensor.dequantize`` / ``fp4_dequantize``), not Marlin's kernel packing that multiplies
scales by ``2**7`` for a different on-device encoding. The quantization is experts-only: every other
linear (hyper-connections, DeltaNet, attention, the router, the shared expert, PLE, embeddings, lm_head,
the MTP head) is stored in BF16.

``FP4`` stores the two halves exactly: ``weight`` the E2M1 code values as bf16 bit patterns (uint16 —
an E2M1 value is a 3-bit bf16 pattern; the patterns are stored so the format's math never goes through
torch's fp8 casts, whose bf16 path yields zeros, and so the reference and the kernel widen the identical
grid), ``scale`` the per-row fp32 dequant weights. ``dequantize`` is the fp32 reference the kernels are
checked against.

The matmul (``matmul``) is the same contract as ``qmm.matmul``, with a 16-wide block and no bias (the
format is purely multiplicative, so no group-input sums travel with the activation): for each 16-input
block b of row m and output column n, with P the tensor-core dot of the block's bf16 inputs and the
block's stored code values,

    y[m, n] = sum over blocks in order, and within a K slice in block order, of  scale(b, n) * P[m, n, b]

K is split into slices fixed by the weight's shape (never the row count) and the slices are summed in slice
order by ``_reduce``. A row's bits depend only on its own input, its own K-slices and the block order:
drafted windows and serial decoding give a row the same bits
(``tests/cuda/test_flashnext_nvfp4.py`` checks it kernel-first, the way ``adding-a-cuda-family.md`` asks).

        bf16 inputs against the block's stored codes, times the block's scale: one fp32 rounding per block
        product, the dequantize reference's order. ``SBN`` is the stored N tile (a constexpr: Triton reads
        no globals) and ``BLOCK_N`` the program's slice of it.

        the even input) and the scales as stored fp8e4m3, both decoded here — the device keeps the file's
        bytes, a quarter of the widened grid. Otherwise the operand is a grid of bf16 patterns (an exact BF16
